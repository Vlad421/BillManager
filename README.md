# BillManager

## Description
BillManager is a home budgeting program designed to help you manage your finances efficiently. It allows you to track your income, expenses, and savings to stay on top of your budget.

## Main Features
- **Organization of Expenses and Income:** Easily record and categorize your various sources of income and types of expenses.
- **Reminders and Future Payments:** Set up reminders for future payments, recurring expenditures, and future incomes to help plan your budget (not implemented yet).
- **Graphical Analysis:** Draw graphs to visualize your financial data (not implemented yet).
- **Computer Vision for Data Input:** Use computer vision to allow easier input of data (will be implemented when base functionalities are completed).
- **LLMs for Analytics:** Leverage large language models to assist with financial analytics and insights (will be implemented when base functionalities are completed).

## Requirements
To build and run BillManager, you need to have the following installed:

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8 or higher.
- **Android SDK:** You can download it from [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- **Gradle:** Usually included with Android Studio, but can also be installed separately.
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge):** Included with the Android SDK.


```

Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` environment variables are set properly.

### For Linux
For Linux, you can set environment variables in the terminal using commands like:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### For Windows
For Windows, you can set environment variables using Command Prompt (CMD). Here's how to do it:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator.**
2. **To set JAVA_HOME, use the following command (replace `C:\path\to\your\jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation directory):**
   ```cmd
   setx JAVA_HOME "C:\path\to\your\jdk"
   ```
3. **To set ANDROID_HOME, use the following command (replace `C:\path\to\your\android\sdk` with the actual path to your Android SDK directory):**
   ```cmd
   setx ANDROID_HOME "C:\path\to\your\android\sdk"
   ```
4. **To add the Android SDK tools and platform-tools directories to the PATH variable, use the following commands:**
   ```cmd
   setx PATH "%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools"
   ```

After setting these environment variables, make sure to restart any open command prompts or terminals for the changes to take effect.
